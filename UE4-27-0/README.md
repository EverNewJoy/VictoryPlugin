# VictoryPlugin Tests

These Blueprint tests show how to use the VictoryHelper plugin and bring in some automated testing.

Four submodules are being developed using this method:
- Json - This provides object to JSON and JSON string to object features.
- WebSockets - Exposes the websockets API based on the standard browser api
- Http - Providing streaming HTTP PUT and HTTP GET methods for larger files.
- MediaOutputSocket - Using the capture API to stream real-time frames to a console program, with FFMpeg as the default target

These four submodules were originally developed by Charles Pritchard at the Walt Disney Company and approved for submission to the VictoryPlugin repository under its open source license. They may be submitted to Epic's Unreal Engine repository once modified for inclusion into the Unreal Engine project.
